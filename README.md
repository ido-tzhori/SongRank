### `playlists` field 
This is an array that typically contains 1,000 playlists. Each playlist is a dictionary that contains the following fields:


* ***pid*** - integer - playlist id - the MPD ID of this playlist. This is an integer between 0 and 999,999.
* ***name*** - string - the name of the playlist 
* ***description*** - optional string - if present, the description given to the playlist.  Note that user-provided playlist descrptions are a relatively new feature of Spotify, so most playlists do not have descriptions.
* ***modified_at*** - seconds - timestamp (in seconds since the epoch) when this playlist was last updated. Times are rounded to midnight GMT of the date when the playlist was last updated.
* ***num_artists*** - the total number of unique artists for the tracks in the playlist.
* ***num_albums*** - the number of unique albums for the tracks in the playlist
* ***num_tracks*** - the number of tracks in the playlist
* ***num_followers*** - the number of followers this playlist had at the time the MPD was created. (Note that the follower count does not including the playlist creator)
* ***num_edits*** - the number of separate editing sessions. Tracks added in a two hour window are considered to be added in a single editing session.
* ***duration_ms*** - the total duration of all the tracks in the playlist (in milliseconds)
* ***collaborative*** -  boolean - if true, the playlist is a collaborative playlist. Multiple users may contribute tracks to a collaborative playlist.
* ***tracks*** - an array of information about each track in the playlist. Each element in the array is a dictionary with the following fields:
   * ***track_name*** - the name of the track
   * ***track_uri*** - the Spotify URI of the track
   * ***album_name*** - the name of the track's album
   * ***album_uri*** - the Spotify URI of the album
   * ***artist_name*** - the name of the track's primary artist
   * ***artist_uri*** - the Spotify URI of track's primary artist
   * ***duration_ms*** - the duration of the track in milliseconds
   * ***pos*** - the position of the track in the playlist (zero-based)

## How was the dataset built
The Million Playist Dataset is created by sampling playlists from the billions of playlists that Spotify users have created over the years.  Playlists that meet the following criteria are selected at random:

 * Created by a user that resides in the United States and is at least 13 years old
 * Was a public playlist at the time the MPD was generated
 * Contains at least 5 tracks
 * Contains no more than 250 tracks
 * Contains at least 3 unique artists
 * Contains at least 2 unique albums
 * Has no local tracks (local tracks are non-Spotify tracks that a user has on their local device)
 * Has at least one follower (not including the creator)
 * Was created after January 1, 2010 and before December 1, 2017
 * Does not have an offensive title
 * Does not have an adult-oriented title if the playlist was created by a user under 18 years of age
